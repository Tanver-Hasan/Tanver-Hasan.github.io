### Summary 

An organization have many applicationns for internal external users. As the compnay grows, it becomes an challange to maintain the users. When it comes to user experience, we do not want to prompt the user to enter credentials in every single applications they use. Having centralized Identity Plarform provides use the ability to maintain the user in a single place and provides the access or permission accurately. On top of that, it allows to maintain the user session and provides Single Sing on experiece. Probably, many organisation are completely depended on Ative directory. However,  Oauth2.0 and OpenID connect are becoming defactor standard in the web for the same purpose. 

IdentiyServer is an opensource project and it implemtns Oauth2.0 and OpenID connect protocols. I would recommend to read IdentityServer4 officila documetation for more detailed discussion.
