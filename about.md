Hi, My name is **Tanver Hasan**. As part of my work, I mainly pay attention to Identity & Access management which include Oauth2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML, ADFS, LDAP, Active Directory, HTTP.  I am a full stack developer. I enjoy writing code. My favourite programming language is C#, Java, Go, Javascript/ Typescript. Currently, I am trying to get hands-on experience in product security as part of my self-study.
